                <p>
                    Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not exactly a sequel, but rather a refinement
                    of what is regarded by many people as the best competitive online FPS ever made.
                    It's a fantastic update to a genuine classic, and essential gaming for Windows and Mac.

                    Our BATTLE ROYALE game-mode will put up to 100 players on a remote island
                    for a winner-takes-allshowdown where strategic gameplay is as important as shooting
                    skills. Players will enter a last-man-standing battle where they try to locate weapons,
                    vehicles and supplies in a graphically and tactically rich battleground that eventually
                    forces players into a shrinking play zone as they engage in a tense and spectacular
                    fight to the death.
